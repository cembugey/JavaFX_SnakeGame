# JavaFX_SnakeGame
A snake game I made using JavaFX 

Snake Game

This is the classic snake game created using JavaFX. This game also includes new features while maintaining the old classic fun. 
Here are some of the features of the game:
1.	8 Bit graphics just like the classic one.
2.  Control the snake using W, A, S, D buttons on your keyboard 
3.	Speed of the snake increases as you progress.
4.	Press P to pause the game, Esc to exit the game
5.	Press C to boost your speed

This game has all the features that of a classic Snake game. The only difference is that it is created using JavaFX.
